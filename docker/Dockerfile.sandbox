# Dockerfile.sandbox — Multi-Runtime Sandbox Image
# ==================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Provides runtime environments for executing repository builds and tests.
#   This image supplies runtimes ONLY — no application logic lives here.
#
# DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
#   - Image provides runtimes only (Node, Python, Java, Go, Rust)
#   - Behavior is determined by command_resolver, not baked into the image
#   - Containers are EPHEMERAL — created and destroyed each iteration
#   - Workspace is MOUNTED as a volume, never copied into the image
#   - No repo cloning happens inside the container
#   - Keep image lean to reduce cold start time (target: < 5s)
#
# RUNTIME SUPPORT:
#   - Python 3.x + pip
#   - Node.js LTS + npm
#   - OpenJDK + Maven/Gradle
#   - Go toolchain
#   - Rust + Cargo
#
# VOLUME MOUNT:
#   /workspace → host workspace directory (the cloned repo)
#
# LIFECYCLE:
#   1. Container created with workspace mounted
#   2. Command resolver provides build/test command
#   3. Command executes inside container
#   4. Logs captured by Build Executor
#   5. Container destroyed
